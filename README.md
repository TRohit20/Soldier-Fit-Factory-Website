# Soldier-Fit-Factory-Website
Hey everybody, this is website I have developed from scratch for the gym I personally workout at.

Tech stack being used: 
HTML
CSS/SASS
JavaScript

Since, We know that we cannot link SASS files directly to the HTML page.
Remember, to run the SASS CSS file, you need to have the watch SASS extension installed and running in order to complile it into a CSS file and link that to HTML.


Feel free to contribute!
