# Introduction

Hey everybody, this is website I have developed from scratch for the gym I personally workout at. The website is intended to serve the gym as a marketing place to showcase what they offer and how it is a better choice and also to get fit.

# Tech Stack Used

HTML

CSS

CSS pre-processsor used SASS

JavaScript

# Installation and Requirements: 
--> You can clone the project directly using Github Desktop or the link to your local directory

--> Install Visual Studio Code with Live server extension and start running the website

--> Since, We know that we cannot link SASS files directly to the HTML page.
--> So remember to run the SASS CSS file, you need to have the "watch SASS" extension installed and running in order to complile it into a CSS file and link that to HTML.
